JavaScript was first released with Netscape 2 early in 1996. It was originally going to be called LiveScript, but it was renamed in an ill-fated marketing decision that attempted to capitalize on the popularity of Sun Microsystem's Java language â€” despite the two having very little in common. This has been a source of confusion ever since.<p>Several months later, Microsoft released JScript with Internet Explorer 3. It was a mostly-compatible JavaScript work-alike. Several months after that, Netscape submitted JavaScript to Ecma International, a European standards organization, which resulted in the first edition of the ECMAScript standard that year. The standard received a significant update as ECMAScript edition 3 in 1999, and it has stayed pretty much stable ever since. The fourth edition was abandoned, due to political differences concerning language complexity. Many parts of the fourth edition formed the basis for ECMAScript edition 5, published in December of 2009, and for the 6th major edition of the standard, published in June of 2015.<h2 id=what-is-first-class-function>What is First-class function?</h2><p>A programming language is said to have First-class functions when functions in that language are treated like any other variable as follows:<pre><code class=\"hljs language-js\"><span class=hljs-comment>// Assign a function to a variable</span>\n<span class=hljs-keyword>const</span> foo = <span class=hljs-keyword>function</span>(<span class=hljs-params>msg</span>) {\n  <span class=\"hljs-language hljs-variable\">console</span>.<span class=\"hljs-function hljs-title\">log</span>(msg, <span class=hljs-string>\"foo\"</span>);\n}\n<span class=\"hljs-function hljs-title\">foo</span>(<span class=hljs-string>\"hi\"</span>);\n\n<span class=hljs-comment>// Pass a function as an Argument</span>\n<span class=hljs-keyword>function</span> <span class=\"hljs-function hljs-title\">bar</span>(<span class=hljs-params>func</span>) {\n  <span class=\"hljs-language hljs-variable\">console</span>.<span class=\"hljs-function hljs-title\">log</span>(<span class=hljs-string>\"bar\"</span>, <span class=\"hljs-function hljs-title\">func</span>());\n}\n<span class=\"hljs-function hljs-title\">bar</span>(foo);\n\n<span class=hljs-comment>// Return a function</span>\n<span class=hljs-keyword>function</span> <span class=\"hljs-function hljs-title\">baz</span>(<span class=hljs-params>msg</span>) {\n  <span class=hljs-keyword>return</span> <span class=hljs-keyword>function</span>(<span class=hljs-params></span>) {\n    <span class=\"hljs-language hljs-variable\">console</span>.<span class=\"hljs-function hljs-title\">log</span>(msg, <span class=hljs-string>\"baz\"</span>);\n  }\n}\n<span class=\"hljs-function hljs-title\">baz</span>(<span class=hljs-string>\"hi\"</span>)();\n</code></pre><h2 id=what-javascript-implementations-are-available>What JavaScript implementations are available?</h2><ul><li>Google's <a href=https://code.google.com/p/v8/>V8</a>:<ul><li>It is used in the Google Chrome browser, Node.js and recent versions of Opera browser.</ul><li><a href=https://www.webkit.org/projects/javascript/index.html>JavaScriptCore</a><ul><li>It is used in some WebKit browsers such as Apple Safari.</ul><li>Mozilla project<ul><li><a href=https://spidermonkey.dev/>SpiderMonkey</a>: The first JavaScript implementation written in C/C++<li><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhino_(JavaScript_engine)>Rhino</a>: written in Java</ul><li><a href=https://my.opera.com/ODIN/blog/carakan-faq>Carakan</a><ul><li>It is used in Internet Explorer.</ul></ul><h2 id=what-is-ecmascript>What is ECMAScript?</h2><p>ECMAScript is the scripting language that forms the basis of JavaScript.<br>The standards for JavaScript are the ECMAScript Language Specification (<a href=https://tc39.es/ecma262/>ECMA-262</a>) and the ECMAScript Internationalization API specification (<a href=https://tc39.es/ecma402/>ECMA-402</a>).<p>The current specification editios are as follows:<ul><li>ECMA-262 11th Edition: <a href=https://ecma-international.org/ecma-262/11.0/index.html>ECMAScript 2020 Language Specification</a><li>ECMA-262 10th Edition: <a href=https://ecma-international.org/ecma-262/10.0/index.html>ECMAScript 2019 Language Specification</a><li>ECMA-262 9th Edition: <a href=https://ecma-international.org/ecma-262/9.0/index.html>ECMAScript 2018 Language Specification</a><li>ECMA-402 5th Edition: <a href=https://github.com/tc39/ecma402>ECMAScript 2018 Internationalization API Specification</a></ul><h2 id=reference>Reference</h2><ul><li><a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/About_JavaScript>About JavaScript</a></ul>"}},"__N_SSG":true}
