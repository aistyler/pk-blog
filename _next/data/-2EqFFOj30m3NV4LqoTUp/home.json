JavaScript was first released with Netscape 2 early in 1996. It was originally going to be called LiveScript, but it was renamed in an ill-fated marketing decision that attempted to capitalize on the popularity of Sun Microsystem's Java language — despite the two having very little in common. This has been a source of confusion ever since.\n\nSeveral months later, Microsoft released JScript with Internet Explorer 3. It was a mostly-compatible JavaScript work-alike. Several months after that, Netscape submitted JavaScript to Ecma International, a European standards organization, which resulted in the first edition of the ECMAScript standard that year. The standard received a significant update as ECMAScript edition 3 in 1999, and it has stayed pretty much stable ever since. The fourth edition was abandoned, due to political differences concerning language complexity. Many parts of the fourth edition formed the basis for ECMAScript edition 5, published in December of 2009, and for the 6th major edition of the standard, published in June of 2015.\n\n## What is First-class function?\nA programming language is said to have First-class functions when functions in that language are treated like any other variable as follows:\n\n```js\n// Assign a function to a variable\nconst foo = function(msg) {\n  console.log(msg, \"foo\");\n}\nfoo(\"hi\");\n\n// Pass a function as an Argument\nfunction bar(func) {\n  console.log(\"bar\", func());\n}\nbar(foo);\n\n// Return a function\nfunction baz(msg) {\n  return function() {\n    console.log(msg, \"baz\");\n  }\n}\nbaz(\"hi\")();\n```\n\n## What JavaScript implementations are available?\n- Google's [V8](https://code.google.com/p/v8/):\n  - It is used in the Google Chrome browser, Node.js and recent versions of Opera browser.\n- [JavaScriptCore](https://www.webkit.org/projects/javascript/index.html)\n  - It is used in some WebKit browsers such as Apple Safari.\n- Mozilla project\n  - [SpiderMonkey](https://spidermonkey.dev/): The first JavaScript implementation written in C/C++\n  - [Rhino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhino_(JavaScript_engine)): written in Java\n- [Carakan](https://my.opera.com/ODIN/blog/carakan-faq)\n  - It is used in Internet Explorer.\n\n## What is ECMAScript?\nECMAScript is the scripting language that forms the basis of JavaScript.\nThe standards for JavaScript are the ECMAScript Language Specification ([ECMA-262](https://tc39.es/ecma262/)) and the ECMAScript Internationalization API specification ([ECMA-402](https://tc39.es/ecma402/)).\n\nThe current specification editios are as follows:\n- ECMA-262 11th Edition: [ECMAScript 2020 Language Specification](https://ecma-international.org/ecma-262/11.0/index.html)\n- ECMA-262 10th Edition: [ECMAScript 2019 Language Specification](https://ecma-international.org/ecma-262/10.0/index.html)\n- ECMA-262 9th Edition: [ECMAScript 2018 Language Specification](https://ecma-international.org/ecma-262/9.0/index.html)\n- ECMA-402 5th Edition: [ECMAScript 2018 Internationalization API Specification](https://github.com/tc39/ecma402)\n\n## Reference\n\n- [About JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/About_JavaScript)\n"},{"file":"languages/typescript/typescript-introduction.md","categories":["languages","typescript"],"slug":"languages$typescript$typescript-introduction","title":"TypeScript Introduction","date":"2021-11-27","tags":["typescript","language","software"],"coverImage":"/imgs/typescript-logo.webp","author":{"name":"peterhs.kang","picture":"/imgs/PK.png"},"status":"published","excerpt":"\n## Introduction\nTypeScript is a programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft.

Every essay or paper designed to be persuasive needs a paragraph at the very outset introducing both the subject at hand and the thesis which is being advanced. It also needs a final paragraph summarizing what's been said and driving the author's argument home.\n\n[//]:---excerpt---\n\nThese are not arbitrary requirements. Introductions and conclusions are crucial in persuasive writing. They put the facts to be cited into a coherent structure and give them meaning. Even more important, they make the argument readily accessible to readers and remind them of that purpose from start to end.\n\nThink of it this way. As the writer of an essay, you're essentially a lawyer arguing in behalf of a client (your thesis) before a judge (the reader) who will decide the case (agree or disagree with you). So, begin as a lawyer would, by laying out the facts to the judge in the way you think it will help your client best. Like lawyers in court, you should make an \"opening statement,\" in this case, an introduction. Then review the facts of the case in detail just as lawyers question witnesses and submit evidence during a trial. This process of presentation and cross-examination is equivalent to the \"body\" of your essay. Finally, end with a \"closing statement\"—that is, the conclusion of your essay—arguing as strongly as possible in favor of your client's case, namely, your theme.\n\nLikewise, there are several things your paper is not. It's not a murder mystery, for instance, full of surprising plot twists or unexpected revelations. Those really don't go over well in this arena. Instead, lay everything out ahead of time so the reader can follow your argument easily. Nor is a history paper an action movie with exciting chases down dark corridors where the reader has no idea how things are going to end. In academic writing it's best to tell the reader from the outset what your conclusion will be. This, too, makes your argument easier to follow. Finally, it's not a love letter. Lush sentiment and starry-eyed praise don't work well here. They make it look like your emotions are in control, not your intellect, and that will do you little good in this enterprise where facts, not dreams, rule.\n\nAll in all, persuasive writing grips the reader though its clarity and the force with which the data bring home the thesis. The point is to give your readers no choice but to adopt your way of seeing things, to lay out your theme so strongly they have to agree with you. That means you must be clear, forthright and logical. That's the way good lawyers win their cases.\n\n## How to Write an Introduction\n\nThe introduction of a persuasive essay or paper must be substantial. Having finished it, the reader ought to have a very clear idea of the author's purpose in writing. To wit, after reading the introduction, I tend to stop and ask myself where I think the rest of the paper is headed, what the individual paragraphs in its body will address and what the general nature of the conclusion will be. If I'm right, it's because the introduction has laid out in clear and detailed fashion the theme and the general facts which the author will use to support it.\n\nLet me give you an example of what I mean. The following is an introduction of what turned out to be a well-written paper, but the introduction was severely lacking:\n\nThe role of women has changed over the centuries, and it has also differed from civilization to civilization. Some societies have treated women much like property, while others have allowed women to have great influence and power.\n\nNot a bad introduction really, but rather scant. I have no idea, for instance, which societies will be discussed or what the theme of the paper will be. That is, while I can see what the general topic is, I still don't know the way the writer will draw the facts together, or even really what the paper is arguing in favor of.\n\nAs it turned out, the author of this paper discussed women in ancient Egypt, classical Greece, medieval France and early Islamic civilization and stressed their variable treatment in these societies. This writer also focused on the political, social and economic roles women have played in Western cultures and the various ways they have found to assert themselves and circumvent opposition based on gender.\n\nGiven that, I would rewrite the introduction this way:\n\nThe role of women <in Western society> has changed <dramatically> over the centuries, <from the repression of ancient Greece to the relative freedom of women living in Medieval France. The treatment of women> has also differed from civilization to civilization <even at the same period in history>. Some societies <such as Islamic ones> have treated women much like property, while others <like ancient Egypt> have allowed women to have great influence and power. <This paper will trace the development of women's rights and powers from ancient Egypt to late medieval France and explore their changing political, social and economic situation through time. All the various means women have used to assert themselves show the different ways they have fought against repression and established themselves in authority.>\n\nNow it is clear which societies will be discussed (Egypt, Greece, France, Islam) and what the general theme of the paper will be (the variable paths to empowerment women have found over time). Now I know where this paper is going and what it's really about.\n\n## How to Write a Conclusion\n\nIn much the same way that the introduction lays out the thesis for the reader, the conclusion of the paper should reiterate the main points—it should never introduce new ideas or things not discussed in the body of the paper!—and bring the argument home. The force with which you express the theme here is especially important, because if you're ever going to convince the reader that your thesis has merit, it will be in the conclusion. In other words, just as lawyers win their cases in the closing argument, this is the point where you'll persuade others to adopt your thesis.\n\nIf the theme is clear and makes sense, the conclusion ought to be very easy to write. Simply begin by restating the theme, then review the facts you cited in the body of the paper in support of your ideas—and it's advisable to rehearse them in some detail—and end with a final reiteration of the theme. Try, however, not to repeat the exact language you used elsewhere in the paper, especially the introduction, or it will look like you haven't explored all aspects of the situation\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAll in all, remember these are the last words your reader will hear from you before passing judgment on your argument. Make them as focused and forceful as possible.\n"},{"file":"about.mdx","categories":[],"slug":"about","title":"About","date":"2021-11-26","tags":["about","life"],"coverImage":"/imgs/PK.png","author":{"name":"peterhs.kang","picture":"/imgs/PK.png"},"status":"published","excerpt":"\n## Contact\n\n- peterhs.kang\n\n","content":"\n## Contact\n\n- peterhs.kang\n\n[//]:---excerpt---\n\n## Dad, Husband, Son, Man\n\n## Location\n\n- [37.558002682827755, 126.86747739761441](https://goo.gl/maps/r4GqyHLU9sdFgKEc9)\n\n[//]: # (TODO: include iframe)\n<iframe\n  src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3162.875062828166!2d126.86528831533107!3d37.55800723237411!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x0%3A0x86a928a385c5d024!2zMzfCsDMzJzI4LjgiTiAxMjbCsDUyJzAyLjkiRQ!5e0!3m2!1sen!2skr!4v1638453488302!5m2!1sen!2skr\"\n  width={600}\n  height={450}\n  style={{border:0}}\n  allow=\"fullscreen\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"/>\n"}]},"__N_SSG":true}
